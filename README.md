DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE  LEARNING ALGORITHMS USING R


Our Disease Prediction system predicts the disease of the user on the based on the symptoms provided by the user , the symptoms are given as an input to the system. The system analyzes the given symptoms and lets user know the disease he / she may have. Our model uses 4 classifier algorithms and takes the mode of the 5 algorithms to provides us the optimal solution.


It is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate and many other factors. Various techniques in data mining and neural networks have been employed to find out the severity of heart disease among humans.
The severity of the disease is classified based on various methods like Support vector  classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier , Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours ,  Decision tree and Logistic Regression. 
 The nature of heart disease is complex and hence, the disease must be handled carefully. Not doing so may affect the heart or cause premature death. The perspective of medical science and data mining are used for discovering various sorts of metabolic syndromes.
